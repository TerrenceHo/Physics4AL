Leaving a blank line starts a paragraph.  Otherwise newlines 
are 
ignored.  Plain text (not containing certain characters that 
have special meaning to TeX) appears more or less as it is typed, 
but lines are collected into paragraphs.

\emph{italics,} {\bf bold,} {\large larger} or {\small smaller} type.

Subscripts$_i$ and superscripts$^{i, j}$.
